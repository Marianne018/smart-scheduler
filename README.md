# Smart Scheduler Project

# A simplified version of a Smart scheduler that automates exam scheduling using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The Smart Scheduler Project is a console-based Python program. This project allow users to do the following:

* Add new exam entries
* Store exam name, date, time, and assigned room.
* View all exam entries
* Edit an existing exam entry
* Delete an exam entry
* Repeat operations until the user exits 
* Menu is simplified, allowing user to easily navigate the operations

# How to use the Code 
1. Make sure Python is installed in your system or there is a python compiler readily available.
2. Clone or download the project.
3. Run the script: 
  scheduler.py

# Limitations and Future Recommendations/enhancements
- Prevent overlapping exam schedules
- Sort entries by date and time

This project is for educational purposes and is open for personal or academic use.
